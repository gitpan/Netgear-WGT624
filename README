Netgear-WGT624 version 0.04
===========================

This project contains scripts and libraries that will parse the HTML
output information from a Netgear 108 Mbps Wireless Firewall Router
(model WGT624).  Basically, with these libraries you can output useful
information, like the packet collisions or transmitted bits per second
to a form that is useful for rrdtool or mrtg (in order to graph
network utilization).

After installing, you will have two options to use this program.
First, you may use the pre-built perl script get-wgt624-status, which
will allow you to query a Netgear 108 Mbps Wireless Firewall Router
from the command line.  Secondly, you will have the library
Netgear::WGT624 installed on your system, which allows a simple
programming interface for querying WGT624 router statistics.

For more information, consult the perldoc pages get-wgt624-status and
Netgear::WGT624 on your system after installation, or on CPAN directory
linked from this project's home page, http://justin.phq.org/netgear/.
